- On a general level I'm interested in econ because it offers a set of quantitative tools for analysing basically any problem
- For these reasons, I'd really like to go to grad school to get a PhD in Econ so I can do research full-time
- It's super early, but I think that I want to go into academia at some point -- both because it would give me the freedom to research whatever I'm interested in and because I think the teaching aspect of it would be really rewarding
- Being an RA is great because it lets me learn what the research side of things looks like, which is what I'm ultimately interested in Econ for
